# Data Managemet for Clinical Research #

## Week 2 - Electronic Data Capture Fundamentals

## Resources


## Standardization of Study Processes
- Processes
    1. Define Projects
        - What is the main priority of the project?
        - What outcomes trying to achieve?
        - What other general short/long term goals?
        - Who are the key personnel?
            - What are priorities for each person involved?
        - What are the project metrics that matter?
    1. Considering Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
        - define the operational/technical components
        - identifying roadblocks and proactively developing solutions
        - hold personnel accountable
        - provide level of transparency
        - written SOP are expectations/requirements
    1. SOP Principles
        - use standard templates, don't reinvent
        - define workflow
        - use broad and generic appraoch that can apply to multiple projects whenever possible
        - don't be too specific 
        - don't set unrealistic standards
        - self-explanatory, standalone documents
            - can be used as training material
        - should be fluid document and reflect ever-changing processes
        - requires significant time and commitment
        - justifying unique process to external processes requires SOP
        - sign-off on all staff and authority
    1. Common SOP Topic Areas or Domain Areas
        1. Administrative
        1. Clinical Procedure and Workflow
        1. Data Management
        1. Laboratory
        1. Pharmacy

## Validated Instruments
- reusing the work of others, do not reinvent 
- leveraging work from others will save time and add credibility
- creating a new measurement method or instrumentation is a study in itself
- source of validated instruments
    - review of literature
    - consult of exports and collaborators
    
    
## Common Standard Terminologies

1. **CDISC** (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium)
1. **LOINC** (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes)
1. **Health Level 7** (HL7)
1. **ICD10/ICD9/ICD-0-3**
1. **SNOMED-CT** (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine, Clinical Terms)

## Regulatory Compliance
1. High Level Regulatory Considerations when Managing Data
    1. **IRB** (Institutional Review Board)
        - human subjects protection
        - guiding principles
            1. respect for persons
                - autonomy, consent, dignity
            1. beneficence 
                - welfare or participants
                - risk/benfit
            1. justice
    1. **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
        - USA centric
        - Rules
            1. privacy rule
            1. security rule
                1. administrative
                1. physical
                1. technical
    1. **FISMA** (Federal Information Security Management Act)
        - USA centric
1. High Level Regulatory Considerations for Electronic Data Systems
    1. **GCP** (Good Clinical Practice)
        - quality standards for designing, conducting and reporting trials
        - mandatory for FDA drugs and IND/IDE studies
        - core principles
            1. respect rights of participants
            1. conducting sound research
    1. **21 CFR - Part 11** (Code of Federal Regulations)
        - USA centric
        - applicability
            1. applicable when using records in electronic format in place of paper format
            1. applicable when using EMR as the main and only source document of patient record 
            1. applicable if for the first time the data are being generated and put directly to electronic system and there is no other source data

## Electronic Data Capture Fundamentals
- Important Functions and Features
    - 
- **REDCap** (Research Electronic Data Capture)
    - stemmed in 2004 from need to manage small/medium size non-trial research projects
    - de-identification process
        1. shifting dates of future dating
        1. identity obfuscation
