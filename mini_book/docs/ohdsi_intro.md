## OMOP CDM ##
![Images](images/omop_cdm.png)

> OMOP data model design is driven by improving health thru generating evidence
- other data model are driven to represent the data fully (e.g. openEHR)
    - for storage purposes

## Real-World Evidence (RWE)
- evidence obtained from real world data (RWD)
    - which are observational data obtained during routine clinical practice
    - generated by
        - electronic health records (EHR)
        - medical claims
        - billing activities databases
        - registries
        - patient-generated data
        - mobile devices
        

### 4 Keys issues of RWE
1. Data Interoperability
    - structures
    - terminilogies
    - languages
1. Standardized analytical pipeline
1. Data network
    - network services
    - data partners
1. Strong Community

## Randomised Control Trial (RCT)
> Conventional randomised controlled trials (RCTs) alone may not provide very good evidence of the relative effectiveness of a new medicine 

> RCTs may be possible to generate **earlier** estimates of the relative effectiveness of the new medicine

> RCT alone cannot provide sufficient data for informed healthcare decision in some siutations.

> Measuring the impact of risk minimisation measures is challenging and using randomized trials to establish the relative effectiveness of different measures would not be ethical once a drug safety risk is identified.

- RWE capture the use of medical treatments in real-life settings when randomization to placebo for clinical trials may be:
    - impossible
    - impractical
    - unethical
    - unfeasible
    - `commorbidities`
    - need external validation
    - RCT may be compromised by very controlled and restricitive criteria

- RCT remains the gold standard

## Observational Study Hierarchy ##
![Images](images/study_heirarchy.png)

## Real-World Data (RWD)
- is an overarching term for data on the effects of health interventions 
    - such as benefits
    - risks 
    - resource use
    - pharmacovigilance
        - Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report
        - Periodic Safety Update Report
        - Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
- that are not collected in the context of  `conventional randomised controlled` trials (RCTs).
- can be collected
    - prospectively 
        - experimental study designs
    - retrospectively (problematic)
        - observational data 
            - observational research is more critical and problematic when it comes comparing the efficacy and safety of treatment of medication
            - but is gold standard for observing something as it happens to a population
                - e.g. observing who in the market place taking the medication in the market
                - e.g. treatment patterns and pathways
        - data from *routine clinical care*
- may include 
    - clinical 
    - economic outcomes
    - patient-reported outcomes
    - health-related quality of life
    
## RWD applications ##
1. When RCT is impossible
    > e.g. no randomised controlled trial of parachutes use, the basis for parachute use is purely observational
1. The data is out there
1. External validity

## RCT exceptions ##
- examples that RCT cannot be used
1. lack of evidence on certain subgroups
1. adherence and persistence in actual price
1. On vs off label-use
1. Risk minimization effectiveness/measures
    
## RWD sources ##
- can be obtained from
    1. structured studies
        - [experimental study designs](https://rwe-navigator.eu/use-real-world-evidence/generate-real-world-evidence/)
        - observational study designs

    - inpatient vs outpatient
    - primary (general practitioner) vs secondary care (specialist)
1. Data Capture process
